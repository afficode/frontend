			<h4>Abusing Boonfu</h4>

			<p className={textStyles}>
				Boonfu and the Boonfu community work together to keep Boonfu working properly and the community
				safe. Please report problems, offensive content, and policy breaches to us using the reporting
				system.
			</p>
			<p className={textStyles}>
				Without limiting other remedies, we may issue warnings; limit or terminate our service; remove
				hosted content and take technical and legal steps to keep users off Boonfu if we think that they
				are creating problems, infringing the rights of third parties or acting inconsistently with the
				letter or spirit of our policies (including, without limitation, circumventing temporary or
				permanent suspensions or harassing the Boonfu employees or other users). However, whether we
				decide to take any of these steps, remove hosted content or keep a user off Boonfu or not, we do
				not have any obligation to monitor the information transmitted or stored on Boonfu, and we do
				not accept any liability for unauthorized or unlawful content on Boonfu or use of Boonfu by
				users.
			</p>
			<h4>Global Marketplace</h4>
			<p className={textStyles}>
				Some of Boonfu&#39;s features and Grabbers may display your ad on other sites, services,
				applications, or tools (together a “Platform”) that are part of the Boonfu community, or on
				third-party Platforms, including social media channels. By using Boonfu, you agree that your ads
				can be displayed on these other Platforms and media channels. You may be subject to additional
				laws or other restrictions in the countries where your ad is posted. When your ad is posted on
				another Platform, you may be responsible for ensuring that it does not violate such other
				Platform&#39;s policies. We may remove your ad if it is reported on Boonfu, or any third-party
				Platform, or if we believe it causes problems or violates any law or policy.
			</p>
			<h4>Fees and Services</h4>
			<p className={textStyles}>
				When you sign up on Boonfu, you may be credited with some amount of token which is obviously
				free. When you begin to post on Boonfu, the token is charged towards whatever you are posting,
				the amount declared as the worth of item/product posted determines how much token is deducted
				from your free tokens, and when that is exhausted, you are expected to “top-up” your token to
				continue using this great service. Also, using the “Grab feature” isn’t free from the get-go,
				please refer to “about grab” through the grab icon to learn more about the commission that
				Grabbers would normally take “IF” your item/product is sold by them, If the service you use
				incurs a fee, you&#39;ll be able to review and accept terms that will be clearly disclosed at
				the time you post your ad. Our fees are quoted in Naira in Nigeria, and may be changed depending
				on the location where you are using Boonfu. We&#39;ll notify you of changes to our fee policy by
				posting such changes on Boonfu. We may choose to temporarily change our fees for promotional
				events or new services; these changes are effective when we announce the promotional event or
				new service.
			</p>
			<p className={textStyles}>
				You are responsible for your token top-up on Boonfu when you are out of tokens or your token is
				running low. If you don&#39;t, without prejudice to any other right or remedy we may be entitled
				to under these Terms of Use or by law, limit your ability to use the services. If your payment
				method fails, you may use other alternatives provided on the Boonfu website.
			</p>
			<p className={textStyles}>
				You acknowledge that your ads may be deleted from Boonfu in case we believe these Terms of Use,
				including our Posting Rules, are breached, either directly or indirectly. In case you paid a fee
				for the display of such ad, you may be entitled to a refund of such fee. However, we reserve the
				right not to refund Boonfu users for any fees paid through the use of Boonfu in the following
				cases:
			</p>
			<ul className={listStyles}>
				<li>
					If you breach, in our opinion, these Terms of Use, which include, without limitation, the
					Policies;
				</li>
				<li>
					If your ads went live with exposure on the Boonfu sites, services, applications or tools, even
					for a limited time, and they benefited from the service associated with the paid fee;
				</li>
				<li>
					If transaction has been completed after 24hrs and all parties settled their fees/payments.
				</li>
				<li>
					If your ads are placed into &quot;edit&quot; mode and will go live on the site once updated by
					you;
				</li>
				<li>If you have removed your ads yourself;</li>
				<li>If you post duplicate ads as defined in our rules regarding duplicate ads;</li>
				<li>If we believe that your ads are in a significantly wrong category;</li>
				<li>If you do not act in good faith and contradict the terms of use of Boonfu</li>
				<li>

				Although users may offer financial products on their ads, Boonfu is in no way involved or liable
				for any loss related to such transactions.
			</p>
			<h4>Display and placement of user ads</h4>
			<p className={textStyles}>
				We strive to create a community where users can find what they are looking for. Therefore, the
				appearance or placement of ads in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors,

			<h4>Infringement</h4>

			<p className={textStyles}>
				Do not post content that infringes the rights of third parties. This includes, but is not
				limited to, content that infringes on intellectual property rights such as copyright, design,
				and trademark (e.g., offering counterfeit items for sale). A large number of products of all
				sorts are offered on Boonfu by private individuals. Entitled parties, in particular owners of
				copyright, trademark rights, or other rights can report any advertisement which may infringe on
				their rights, and submit a request for such advertisement to be removed. If a legal
				representative of the entitled party reports this to us in the correct manner, products
				infringing on the intellectual property rights will be removed by Boonfu.
			</p>
			<p className={textStyles}>Reporting an infringement:</p>
			<p className={textStyles}>

				<Link className="underline text-primary">Notice of Infringement Form</Link> and email it to

				<Link className="underline text-primary">This Form</Link>, complete with your signature, to
				report advertisements which may infringe on your property rights. The information requested in
				the Notice of Infringement Form is for the purpose of ensuring that the parties reporting these
				objects are either the entitled party or their officially authorized representative. This
				information must also enable Boonfu to identify the advertisement to be removed. Once we have
				received your correctly completed Notice of Infringement Form, you can simply send later reports
				to Boonfu via the e-mail address provided.
			</p>
			<p className={textStyles}>
				Note: This form can only be used by the lawful owners of the relevant intellectual property

				or personal injury resulting from our negligence or the negligence of our agents or employees.
				You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do.{' '}
			</p>
			<p className={textStyles}>
